Firstly, this is pretty cool my friend - thanks for sharing! I will have to play around with this on my developer blog and portfolio GitPages SSG site repo which is based on Jekyll and GitActions...

One suggestion did occur to me however, and I am curious to hear what you and other members of the dev community think...

Rather than firing your actions workflow job in response to the on-issue event - why not trigger based on new Discussions / Comments on Discussions and leave the issue tracking feature as is to be used for code base issue tracking?

See: [Github Docs - Events that trigger workflows - discussion](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#discussion)
